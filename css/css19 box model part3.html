<p class="para2"> Have a Nice Day. Very Nice.Get ready for some truly delightful, faith-in-humanity-restoring news: The exact date of the “good day” that Ice Cube famously rapped about in his 1992 song “It Was a Good Day” has been positively identified by an extremely intrepid, heroic blogger. Using flawless deductive reasoning, Murk Avenue has concluded that the good day in question was January 20, 1992. The logic is as follows: The song, which was released on February 23, 1993, references Yo MTV Raps, which began airing on August 6, 1988, creating a potential five-year window when the titular good day  could have occurred. </p>
